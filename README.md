# Ola Movies Scraper

Get Loan2Host links from OlaMovies. It ignores the annoying link shortner and provides a link from only Loan2Host for each codec in OlaMovies.



## Documentation

`pip install beautifulsoup4 requests urlib`

Then run the Scraper.py.
and Enter the OlaMovies url you want to get links for.

for Eg: 
https://olamovies.uno/the-valet-2022-720p-1080p-2160p-4k-dsnp-web-dl-x265-hevc-english-ddp-5-1-msub/
